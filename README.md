# Coloring_Game_Helper
A Script for the game series "Coloring Game" from L. Stotch

This script was written by RoboOctopus on GitHub / DasDreieck#4235 on Discord

I wrote this little script for fun and to challange myself. 


To use it the script effectively the game should: 
	- look like "example.png"
	- be on the first Monitor
	- be in fullscreen



Searching collors can't yet be chanched, witch I plan on changing in the Future.

To exit hold v till the finished pop-up pops up.



KNOWN PROBLEMS:
    - The script sometomes gets stuck clicking single objects, hold the "c" key for it to switch modes.
    - The scipt can get hung up on shades of green that look very similar, try to right click a grey block. If that doesnt work press esc and the scipt will exit.

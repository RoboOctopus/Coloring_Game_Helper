# Coloring_Game_Helper
A Script for the game series "Coloring Game" from L. Stotch

This script was written by RoboOctopus on GitHub / DasDreieck#4235 on Discord

I wrote this little script for fun and to challange myself. 


To use it the script effectively the game should: 
	- look like "example.png"
	- be on the first Monitor
	- be in fullscreen



Searching collors can't yet be chanched, witch I plan on changing in the Future.

To exit hold v till the finished pop-up pops up.



KNOWN PROBLEMS:
	- Non yet

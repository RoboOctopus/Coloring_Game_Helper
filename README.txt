This script was written by RoboOctopus on GitHub / DasDreieck#4235 on Discord

I wrote this little script for fun and to challange myself. 
You may use it in what what everway you see fit.


To use it the script effectively the game should:
    - look like "example.png" in the folder 
    - be on the first Monitor
    - be in fullscreen

Press the Start button if the is open and a Picture is ready to be colored.

Searching collors can't yet be chanched witch I plan on changing in the Future.

To exit hold v till the finished popup pops up.


KNOWN PROBLEMS:
    - Skips the waiting step and clicks the blocks again while waiting for the game to load. Can cause a crash if the image is too big.


Dependencies : opencv-python,pyautoguikeyboard,mouse,numpy,ttkbootstrap

To run the script onpen cmd in the correct file path and paste "python3 _main_.py".

I wrote this little script for fun and to challange myself. 
You may use it in what what everway you see fit.


To use it the script effectively the game should:
    - look like "example.png" in the folder 
    - be on the first Monitor
    - be in fullscreen

Press the Start button if the is open and a Picture is ready to be colored.

Searching collors can't yet be chanched witch I plan on changing in the Future.

To exit hold v till the finished popup pops up.


KNOWN PROBLEMS:
